### Record vs. Map

- **Use `Record` when**: You are working with objects that have a fixed shape for values and string keys. 
It's ideal for typing object literals with known value types.
- **Use `Map` when**: You need more flexibility with keys (not just strings or numbers),
 or you need to maintain the insertion order of your keys. Maps also provide better performance for large sets of data,
  especially when frequently adding and removing key-value pairs
